### This Week in Code Immersives lore, 

#### we went back to  our old pal(s), **CSS**, 

and learned a few *new* things: 

**FlexBox** and **CSS Grid**.

|Flexbox    | CSS Grid     | 
| :------------- | :----------: |
|  * Flexbox is great at aligning the content inside elements. Use flex to position the smaller details of a design. | * CSS grids are great for building the bigger picture. They makes it really easy to manage the layout of the page, and can even handle more unorthodox and asymmetrical designs.   |
|* Flexbox works better in one dimension only (rows **OR** columns).  |* Use CSS grids for 2D layouts (rows **AND** columns). |
|* Flexbox enables you to allocate space and align items flexibly.   |CSS Grid focuses on precise content placement | || |
